# Project State

Last updated:

## Current Objective
- Finish the Dark Sun smoke test and audit pass, keep the setting integration stable, and preserve unsupported mechanics as explicit stubs.

## Repository Snapshot
- Branch: `main` (audit-pass commit pending)
- HEAD at last context refresh: `8f25eca`
- Harness status for this pass:
  - `pnpm loop:check` -> `=== ALL_PASS ===` after Dark Sun audit fixes

## Completed Work (Current Session)
- Kept the normalized Dark Sun pack in place under `apps/web/content/packs/darksun` with:
  - 13 backgrounds
  - 8 Athasian species
  - Elemental Cleric class and elemental domain subclasses
  - Dark Sun skills, setting metadata, Wild Talent data, Psionicist stub, and Athasian Bard stub
- Audited Dark Sun setting selection and content filtering in the builder.
- Fixed the concrete Dark Sun bug found during the audit:
  - classes listed in `classReplacements` are now treated as unavailable in Dark Sun mode, so SRD `Cleric` no longer appears alongside `Elemental Cleric`
- Improved Dark Sun builder notes so restricted classes resolve to display names even after filtering.
- Reconfirmed the closed-loop harness with `pnpm loop:check`.

## Remaining Limitations (Explicit)
- Defiler casting remains a stub.
- Psionicist is selectable only as a stub class.
- Athasian Bard is selectable only as a stub subclass.
- Wild Talent currently supports table-backed selection/display only; mechanical effects are not automated.
- Elemental Cleric spell lists only reference spells that already exist as native spell entities; unsupported source spells are preserved in `apps/web/content/packs/darksun/settings/elemental-cleric-spell-source.json`.
- Dark Sun language rules are surfaced in setting metadata/UI notes, not a full language-pick workflow.

## Notes for Next Runner Session
- If the Dark Sun source bundle changes, regenerate with:
  - `node scripts/ingest-dark-sun-homebrew.mjs`
- Keep Dark Sun filtering data-driven via:
  - `apps/web/content/packs/darksun/settings/*.json`
  - `apps/web/src/lib/packSettings.ts`
- Re-run `pnpm loop:check` after any content, builder, or context edit.
